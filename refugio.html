							<h2>Cafe Refugio</h2>
							<p> Tucked into a side street of the vibrant Neukölln area, Cafe Refugio is a home for community, service, and cultural celebration in Berlin. A nonprofit cafe and a part of a larger housing initiative to support refugees in the city, Cafe Refugio is not only a full-service coffee shop, but a place for events ranging from social cooking to yoga and German language practice cafes. Most recently, they have hosted informal coffee salons for Ukrainian refugees in the city, hoping to be a resource and center for support. Started in 2015 as a reaction to the Syrian refugee crisis, the organization has grown to embrace refugees from around the world.

							<p>Refugio houses 30 or so residents with a mix of German and refugee backgrounds. They focus not only on basic needs and providing shelter, but rather providing a safe, warm, and welcoming space for everyone who walks through the door. They build a natural community—there are no social service members on staff. Instead, they bring volunteers together and provide mutual support for their refugee community. In this way, they hope to welcome refugees more organically and support them in building authentic lives in Berlin.

							<p>SThrough the cafe, a variety of community workshops, social cooking, and house dinners, Refugio is a prime example of food being used to generate and build community. Each Wednesday, residents and outside community members come together for “social cooking.” This group cooks in community and brings in guest chefs for workshops like pasta making. Monthly “house dinners” were a pre-covid highlight, bonding the living residents together through food. Weekly, volunteers take shifts as baristas and bake the sweets for the shop. As a social enterprise, the project is funded mainly through space rentals and catering, while the cafe operates as a community hub generating nominal income. Refugio is an ecosystem powered by people and food.
