							<h2>Sim Sim</h2>
							<p> Opened in 2018, Sim Sim describes itself as “a homey Levantine eatery serving authentic dishes, both traditional and modern, in a contemporary setting.” With inspiration from the levantine region–an area that now consists of bordered countries– Sim Sim serves traditional dishes in a modern Berlin setting. We sat with restaurant owner, Marwan Fakhereddin, in the cozy neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg to discuss Levantine food, his Palestinian roots, and his experience here in Berlin. </p>

							<p>Marwan grew up in Jordan, moving to Berlin in 2015. He was raised in the restaurant business and saw a gap upon settling here in the city. People were accustomed to middle eastern food as street food, and he wanted to display his culture and food in a more upscale setting. He notes many of his customers are German Jewish or Israeli and the restaurant is,“a good way to show them exactly what we are not and surprise them in some ways.”</p>

							<p>When questioned about naming the restaurant a Levantine eatery, he noted how important labeling is today. Many people who eat at Sim Sim assume it is an “Israeli” restaurant, but Marwan shares that he uses the title of Levantine as a point of conversation. He uses the word Levantine to describe a region that predated the arbitrary borders drawn post World War II.  Even the word Middle East comes with its connotations, referring to a more modern and divided region. </p>

							<p>“Arabic food is not being recognized as Arabic food which is sad.” Marwarn shares that when his grandparents were younger, there was no discussion about who is who and what religion their neighbors were; they all just shared food. He thoughtfully describes the concept of Levantine-style shareable plates, a concept many Germans are not used to. Culturally, sharing all the meals with your family is traditional in the Levantine region. It is a great way to bring people together. “There was a time when all people enjoyed food together.” In the restaurant, pictures of Muslims and Jews together across the Middle East plaster the walls: in old Jerusalem, a coffee shop in Damascus, and architectural sites in Beirut. </p>

							<p>“I don’t like labeling,” he advocates for food coexistence instead.“There are also some places that say this is Israeli hummus or Israeli salad, which personally I am not with. Israeli is also Arabic salad, the same salad my grandma used to make… At the end of the day, no one cares where the falafel is from, it's falafel.” </p>
