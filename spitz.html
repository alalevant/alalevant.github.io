							<h2>Tal Alon</h2>
							<p>  Tal Alon is the founder of <a href="https://www.spitzmag.de/"> Spitz Magazine</a>, the first Hebrew magazine geared towards Israelis in Berlin focused on cultural, social, and political issues and information. Arriving in 2009, she tells us “the story of why we came is different from why we stayed.” Eventually, after laying roots in the city and observing Tel Aviv’s impossible housing market, she and her partner decided to stay in Berlin and start a family. 
<br>
	Now, she runs Spitz online and works on networking for the <a href="https://www.dizf.de/english/home/index.html">Israeli Future Forum</a>. She sees Spitz as not just a news publication but a community project, a part of a new wave of  “community journalism.” She tells us, “Language is such a crucial part of my life” so it was natural to find the Israeli community here in Berlin. As a result, she found a need for relevant information in language for the growing number of Israelis in Berlin.

							<p>In our research, we constantly questioned the intersection between Jewish and Israeli identity and discussed this further with Alon, “If you spoke with me in the first years there was a complete detachment from the Israeli and Jewish community. Things have changed…Jewishness does not even mean religion. It is a community thing, a cultural thing. What's been happening in the past years is a dual process. On one hand enough Israelis have been living here for a long time to realize that the concept of Judaism is different outside of Israel and the Jewish community has a lot of means here, so if you need resources for activities you better collaborate with Jewish institutions.” Although, she deviates to say that this new consciousness is much more prevalent amongst organizations rather than individuals. People continue to be separate, although organizations, like the Jewish school who now hosts many Israelis, are more integrated.

							<p>While her own children did not go to the Jewish school due to distance, she now describes the positive relationships she has with her Arab and Muslim neighbors in Kreuzberg, sharing that her children's school is over half Muslim. As a lover of tahini (sesame pasta), she tells us about her shopping in Neukölln, a predominantly Arab neighborhood in Berlin, in search of this kitchen staple. She shares, “I love the combination of Germany and the Middle East….Food plays a huge role in life here.” In an Israelis in Berlin Facebook group, members are on a constant search for good Tahini. While there are a few Jewish supermarkets that sell tahini from Israel, Alon shares, “In every Arab or Turkish food market, you can get great tahini from Lebanon or other places for much less. Tahini is huge.” Shared food, tradition, and geographic culture living as immigrants can be a source of interpersonal exposure that is atypical in Israel.

And, of course, we discussed hummus. “There is always this tension of presenting hummus as an Israeli dish when we know it was Arab and then appropriated by Israel.” She reflects on a “discourse of authenticity” and frequent conversations about where you can get the best Levantine staples. A big part of Spitz, with over 20,000 views, is its <a href"https://www.spitzmag.de/kulinarish-map/" >culinary index and map </a>. As one of their most visited articles, it is now a staple of their homepage. She describes it as an, “accumulated work of years” that had to be recently updated due to COVID-19 closures. 
<br>
She tells us, “People miss their Home food…Israeli tourists are looking for places…Food is something that people love. I mean why are all the Instagram accounts and YouTube channels? Food is something people like and identify with and need on a daily basis. And I think it is obvious.”
