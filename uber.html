							<h2>Über den Tellerrand</h2>
							<p> <a href = "https://ueberdentellerrand.org/" > Über den Tellerrand</a> was started in 2013 when protests over increased refugees took place at Oranienplatz. The student founders realized that the protesters had heard of refugees and held negative stereotypes but lacked interpersonal contact and humanizing relations. How to build relationships? Bringing pots and pans to Oranienplatz in Kreuzberg, the founders began to do the most unexpected yet simple act: cook. As more people began to inquire about their activities or help out with the cooking, the founders realized that they were one to something, an activity that could help promote discussion and interaction. Soon the community grew so large, that through a Funpreneur competition they began to create a cookbook. They hoped to create a social enterprise, which eventually transitioned to an NGO, funding their work through cookbook proceeds.  </p>

							<p>Now as an NGO, the Über den Tellerrand or “Out of the Box” in English, connects people through cooking. They host various events from cooking to beekeeping to dancing, focused on bridging community members from diverse backgrounds through shared experience and food. Today they have 40+ satellite locations globally and a moving “container” hosting events in communities across Germany. Über den Tellerrand is a model for bridging refugees and nonrefugees globally. </p>

							<p>The organization focuses on empowering participants to plan their own events in community, while supporting them with logistical resources. “The main idea is to have this meeting point. People meet, cook together. It is not that much about integration because integration has those negative side effects that you lose the culture of other people. So it is more about respecting the culture, but still guaranteeing they can be a part of society. What we try to guarantee is social participation and inclusion.” In our meeting with Anna, a Berlin-based volunteer coordinator, she described how the population of attendees changes based on demographic shifts. For example, they are now seeing more Ukrainian participants due to the recent conflict, in comparison to the past where there were more African and Middle Eastern populations. </p>

							<p>We were interested to understand how the NGO encountered conflict in their work. She mentions that, of course, there is conflict, but most of it comes from ignorant or unintentional racism. She discusses one conflict where the group wanted to eat at a falafel place next door, which was Israeli, but some Palestinian participants didn’t want to eat there. The Israelis were upset, and program organizers were overwhelmed, leading them to change the restaurant, at the Israeli participants’ disappointment. From this, the organization learned much about conflict resolution and now trains facilitators in non-violence communication.</p>

							<p>She tells us about the organization's most popular event, 50 plates of “something.” Each month the theme changes, and volunteers cook 50 types of a dish together. For example, 50 plates of rice would include different styles of rice from Asia to Latin America and the Middle East. People discuss the origins of their food, prepare it together, and come back and enjoy cooking and eating together. It is free and everyone can participate. She describes it as a true exchange because people can teach one another. The bottom line is, “Bringing people together through food works.” At Über den Tellerrand participants make friends, form romantic relationships, and even find jobs. Food is a catalyst for community; cooking is just the start. </p>
