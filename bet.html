							<h2>Bet Deborah</h2>
							<p> In a cozy cafe in central Mitte, we are introduced to Karen Margolis and Marion Boeker of <a href="https://www.bet-debora.net/" >Bet Deborah </a>, a forum for diverse female Jewish empowerment. A boisterous organization that is in a midpoint between a jewish studies group and an activist collective, Bet Deborah was started in the 90’s in berlin. Margolis and Boeker embued the feminist spirit of the group, thoughtfully reflecting on their own Jewish roots coming from Great Britian and Germany, respectively. Boeker is a historian looking at the Jewish history of Hamburg, while consulting on gender budgeting professionally. Margolis, a poet and co-leader of the group, touches on the evolution of Berlin’s Jewish community-- now one that is safer and more welcoming to female Jewish perspectives. Recently, Bet Deborah published <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Bet-Debora-Journal-Alternativen-Alternatives/dp/3955652645" >Jewish Women in Europe: Creating Alternatives </a> and is hosting a conference in September to celebrate and showcase members of the group.

							<p>When questioned about their interactions with communities of different faiths, they speak positively about their interactions with like-minded Muslim feminist groups, as well as the growing project <a href = "https://house-of-one.org/en" >House of One </a>, a plan for a connected Jewish, Christian, and Muslim prayer space in Berlin. With less of a focus on Israel, Bet Deborah’s primary mission is the empowerment of women in Jewish religious spaces. In their rhetoric, mission, and programming, we found a common theme--they connect with diverse populations, including those that are non-Jewish, through the lens of female empowerment. Common struggles associated with religiosity and gender are incentives for women to participate and engage with those they might not otherwise interact with.
