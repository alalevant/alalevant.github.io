							<h2>Schneiderei</h2>
							<p> We had the privilege of sitting down with chef <b>Liron Schneider</b> to discuss the art of his food and how he ended up in Berlin. He starts by clarifying, “Just to be upfront my cuisine is not Israeli. I am from Israel…but the food is not bound to a certain kitchen. It is mostly modern Mediterranean.”  </p>

							<p>As a lifelong informal chef, he started working in England, hosted dinners with the EatWith network in London, and found his calling by creating a hit pop-up in the Tel Aviv Carmel market called the <a href="https://www.timeout.com/israel/restaurants/zalabia">Zalabia Store</a>. After returning to Tel Aviv, he was set on starting a restaurant and was drawn to Berlin’s up-and-coming food scene and his existing network of friends. For two years, he continued with private events and pop-ups at Street Food Thursdays at <a href="https://markthalleneun.de/kalender/street-food-thursday-dritter-oktober/ ">Markthalle Neun</a>, creating his own croissant/brioche rolls.

<br>
Today he has two restaurants— <a href="https://www.schneidereifood.com/our-story">SCHNEIDEREI</a>  and <a href="https://www.kadewe.de/store/restaurants_bars.html">ESSER</a>.  SCHNEIDEREI is a neighborhood source-oriented fine dining restaurant mainly serving German hipsters and locals, while Esser in KaDeWe focuses on fast service and Mediterranean fusion.

							<p>We asked Schneider about his Israeli identity and food. He responded, “What is Israeli cuisine? Think about it. What would you consider an Israeli dish? Hummus? Of course, it’s not Israeli. It’s not rooted in Israel, it's not Jewish. Israel is a part of this Levantine area of the world. We are becoming a part of it. We are very good at learning and being educated. And the contribution of us is to learn these cuisines that are very rich and have such deep culture and hundreds of years of cooking these dishes all around Israel and we have to learn and take those dishes and infuse it with a lot of the food education from the western world. Is it better than the Syrian grandma? No. But it is more curated for the western palette.”

							<p>Schneider shared similar sentiments to other Israeli chefs when discussing his friendships with Arabs in the food industry. He reflects on a friendship he made with a Palestinian chef at a food festival, their booths side by side, sharing food and a long standing historical roots.</p>
