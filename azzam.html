							<h2>Azzam</h2>
							<p> Deep into the neighborhood of Neukölln we found ourselves waiting in a long line of hummus hopefuls. The clientele was a mix of German hipsters, expats, and locals - a plethora of languages to be heard. Open from 8 am to 12 am, Azzam serves its customers at all hours. For the past twenty years, Azzam has served four euro hummus and Mussabaha to its regulars. Known for its cheap, delicious food, and its noteworthy Fatteh, a traditional combination of yogurt and chickpeas, Azzam was listed as one of Berlin’s Top 50 eateries as “the most amazing example of Berlin’s Middle Eastern food culture.” The surrounding neighborhood is filled with similar hummus spots, but no other place had a line out the door and was recommended to us by so many Berliners. </p>

							<p>As soon as we stepped up to the counter were handed a package of pita and found the all-you-can-drink tea corner, we knew we would be sitting for longer than just the meal. Families gathered around tables sharing plates and plates of food, young couples splitting an endless bowl of hummus on a date, friends slumped out in their chairs after their food coma - this was a place for everybody. </p>

							<p>We heard our food order number called out in Arabic and got ready to feast. Served a piping hot platter, we dug in tasting the famed Azzam hummus, falafel, and salads. The crispy falafel was the right amount of fried, and the warm vegetables and halloumi were contrasted by a chilled bed of lettuce and smooth hummus, making for the most perfect combination. We spent our time eating mostly in silence, overtaken by the rich flavors, satiating food, and communal meal.</p>

							<p>Azzam is described as a typical immigrant restaurant, supplying its broad customer base with food traditional to its Lebanese and Palestinian ownership. It was clear that the restaurant served a variety of clientele, from hungry tourists to locals. In a recent article exploring hummus in Berlin, owner Hussam Azzam says the Israeli community is very welcome, as well, “They say that when they come here they feel at home. They usually order hummus, musabaha and falafel.” Jokingly he adds, “I can tell if someone is from Israel or Palestine, I know because of the way they say hummus.”</p>

							<p>Hussam welcomes an international clientele, with immigrants and refugees from across the Levantine region finding their native food in this local spot.  While some people come for the hummus, among their Israeli and Syrian customers, they are most pleased to find Mussabaha, a dish with similar ingredients to hummus, but with fresher, spicier, and bolder ingredients. In an interview Hussam describes the dish as “Arabic penicillin," the spicy flavor helping cure a cold. Hussam notes, “I only want to make food,” he says. “I am not political. I don’t want war. I want both sides to get on.” Azzam is a prime example of a place where those from across the Levantine region, and those eager to experience it, can come together to find dishes that make them feel at home.</p>
