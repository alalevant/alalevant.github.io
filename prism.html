							<h2>Prism</h2>
							<p> <b>Gal Ben Moshe</b>, chef of Berlin’s Prism and now Tel Aviv’s Pastel, first confesses “I was traumatized by the idea of people expecting me to cook Levantine food or middle eastern food, so I was forcibly avoiding it.” He charmingly admits that he was already 15 when he first tried his first falafel in Tel Aviv. As the child of eclectic foodies, he describes going to Chinese and French restaurants growing up, not taking part in the cuisine traditional to his geographic position. </p>

							<p>Moshe jokingly remarks he came to Berlin to open a restaurant hoping it would be a lower cost alternative, starting with “just eclectic food.” It wasn’t until he had the opportunity to do a collaborative dinner with a Lebanese wine maker that he started experimenting with Arabic food. Soon he began researching Arabic food from a pan-Arabic perspective, not a nationalistic one. This research culminated into the “best dinner he has ever cooked”, and as such vowed to pursue variations of Arabic or Levantine cuisine moving forward.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Opening a Levantine restaurant is an endeavor that does not come without the weight of Moshes identity as an Israeli and fighting a culture where “the thing to do is to take your neighbors (food) and call it your own.” Today, Moshe tries to use his food and unique position as an esteemed Israeli chef to pay tribute, rather than appropriate food from the Levantine region. He tells us he “is creating a new language for Levantine food.” He successfully attempts to use ingredients and techniques from the Levantine region in an uncommon way to tell a new story of an intertwined middle east. For example, Prism’s main dish is inspired by the national dish of Aleppo. He shares that as it is served to each table, the waiters note that it is a tribute to its Syrian origins and intentionally disconnected from authenticity. Moshe comes back to the idea of steering clear of authentic origins, his cooking is almost academic with passion woven through. He is not cooking his grandma’s food.</p>

							<p>Gal’s love for Berlin is clear. When asked, “why Berlin?” He mentions that it is a new and more forgiving market for young people with ideas. “It is a place to grow.” He doesn’t like being known as the Israeli chef in town, he notes he is most proud when he is noted as just another great chef. He self identifies as a Berliner, jokingly asking his girlfriend in the interview if he qualifies yet. His personal narrative comes through in his food, “It is very much an identity crisis…I cook myself…yes the food is grounded in Levantine ingredients, but it is very international technique wise or language wise…my food is my story.”</p>

							<p>Most recently, he led the reopening of the famed Pastel restaurant in Tel Aviv. He jokes that before, he publicly stated that he would never open a restaurant in Tel Aviv. But, Pastel was special. He describes the physical beauty of the space, “my heart skipped a beat.” He talks about bringing art back to food in Israel to“fight a culture that celebrates serving food in a pita or pouring Arak on a grill to create flames to create atmosphere…we want to give food that has meaning.” Now splitting his time in Berlin and Tel Aviv, Gal is hoping to bring new energy, passion, and stories to both cities.  </p>

							<p>Gal continuously describes using his own platform as a space for coexistence, “what hurts me the most is that we have a tendency to take Palestinian food and call it ours and..it is more than cultural appropriation, we are canceling their culture.” In Israel he sources his ingredients from Palestinian farmers and celebrates their narratives. Even in Berlin, as we are served a decadent meal we are exposed to the stories of Palestinian wine, hand rolled Maftoul, and Israeli caviar in front of us. “We are telling the story of coexisting in the space…we try our best to live up to what we believe in.”</p>

							<p>When asked about his interactions with Palestinains here in Berlin he lovingly reflects on his friendships, “We are the same. There is an imaginary border on a map. If you take the person out of the conflict, we have so much in common. We get along…Same thing with the Lebanese. It is crazy how much easier it is for me to interact with them versus with Germans. Then you put us in Israel, and because the situation is one political and two imbalanced, there is no space to talk.” He mentions is grateful for the influx of refugees, specifically from Syria, as they have made ingredients typical to the Middle East more accessible. Essentials for his cooking, like Alya (sheeps tail fat) used to be scarce, and now are readily available. A balance must be found between embracing and appreciating culture to appropriating it, “When an israeli chef cooks something that isn't his, he needs to be a bit more sensitive, but that is my perspective.” </p>
