							<h2>Mont Raw</h2>
							<p> For restaurant owner <b>Shimon Rokhlin</b>, Berlin was the last place he thought he would be. With a family history intertwined with the Holocaust, Rokhlin never planned to move to a city filled with so much traumatic history for the Jewish people. Now, he leads <a href="https://montraw.com">Mont Raw</a>, a modern Levantine restaurant with a decadent garden and a direct view of the Neu synagogue (The New Synagogue), which he notes was what he took as an affirming sign for opening the restaurant in this location. After arriving in Berlin five years ago to help a friend with a restaurant, he saw a gap in Levantine fine dining experiences. Starting with a small club restaurant in Prenzlauer Berg, we interviewed him at Mont Raw, his second restaurant that he opened together with Chef Ben Barabi just one month before the COVID pandemic.

							<p>When we first came across Mont Raw, we were interested in their marketing of the cuisine as Levantine, something we hadn’t heard of. Shimon describes his decision to market the restaurant as Levantine— “What is an Israeli restaurant? There is no such thing really…It is always different.” He walks us through the progression of Israeli food, which is constantly evolving. At first Israeli chefs mixed French styles with middle eastern flavors. Now, Moroccan and Yemenite influences are popping up more and more. Flavors and styles are constantly changing, so Israeli food is not fixed. Therefore, he serves food from the Levant, a mixture of flavors and culture.

							<p>Shimon describes the restaurant audience as 50% Germans, 20% Israelis, and 30% tourists. He tells us about the restaurant’s growing community of Germans interested in Israel. The restaurant hosts dinner for friends, and will host jewish holiday events, sometimes even kiddush and a Pesach seder where they invite customers.

							<p>When asked about his work with the muslim community, he shares that he works with many Muslim suppliers and restaurant owners. “It is super nice because it is much easier to do than in Israel…the friendships you can build here are much friendlier and clearer.” Shimon describes a food ecosystem where Palestinian and Israeli chefs can support one another in an intentional way outside of the pressures of the Middle East.</p>
