							<h2>Itay Novik</h2>
							<p>  As newbies to the Berlin food scene, we searched for guidance on where to start and found ourselves both a tour guide and friend, Itay Novik. Originally from Israel, trained in Italy, and now calling Berlin his home, Itay is the epitome of what our project is about. He is a passionate food consumer and educator, with love for bringing people together around the table. Through his brand, <a href="https://www.foodelements.net/" >Elements of Food</a>, he leads food tours around Berlin, prepares his own style of untraditional Israeli/ Jewish cuisine for large Shabbat dinners and intimate gatherings, and is well known by chefs and community members throughout the Israeli and Jewish Berlin-based community.

After falling in love with the city on a trip, he moved to Berlin in 2011 and never looked back. Today his work spans from virtual cooking classes to in-person tours and a thriving catering business. He describes his food as “mediterranean,”“middle-eastern,” and has invented his own concept of “fine-dining Jewish food.” As a part of the food festival, <a href="https://www.eat-berlin.de/?lang=en" > EAT!BERLIN </a>, he launched a  “strictly non-kosher Jewish dinner.” With dishes like gefilte fish with eel, this four-course meal was non-kosher in its own way. Itay takes a cautious approach to the cultural implications of food describing upscale Israeli cuisine as often, “taking the Arab food and wrapping it in a nice box.” He notes, “I am very careful about food-washing…a lot of what Israel is doing is putting food in front.”

							<p>Our time with Itay helped us understand the differences between the Israeli and Jewish communities in Berlin, they often don’t overlap. In the past he led a Jewish food festival, but the project ended because the reality is that there is not a big Jewish food scene and it felt performative. Israelis dominate Berlin’s restaurant ecosystem, leaving little space for Jewish cuisine. Itay describes that the mostly Russian religious Jewish community prioritizes kosher restrictions, with taste and style coming second. With Jewish culture days returning this fall, an all-kosher food festival will take place in Berlin. While there will be several stands, Itay describes that most of them are created by one caterer, showing the lack of diversity in Jewish/ Kosher food available.

							<p>Itay participates in <a href="http://shalom-rollberg.de/" >Shalom Rollenberg </a>, an initiative promoting exposure between Jewish and Muslim communities in Berlin through programming for children. Itay led a cooking workshop for Palestinian youth, noting that many of them have Lebanese backgrounds and now identify as German. Itay isn’t shy to talk about conflict in the face of food, “Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. There is a conflict. Of course we have to talk about it.”
