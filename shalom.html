							<h2>Shalom Aleikum</h2>
							<p> It was a warm summer evening when we found ourselves in the heart of our Kreuzberg neighborhood, sitting next to our new neighbors at a panel hosted by <b>Shalom Aleikum</b>, a coexistence initiative funded by the Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees, and Integration. With the mission of breaking down xenophobia and racist prejudice, specific to anti-semitism and anti-muslim sentiment, Shalom Aleikum invites guest speakers for moderated discussions on a variety of topics open to the public. As a part of their series of roundtable discussions, we attending a Jewish-Muslim discussion “discussing the social changes and debates that have followed the waves of flight and immigration in recent years and the current refugee movement from a Jewish and Muslim perspective.” Hosting writer Lena Gorelik and journalist Michael Abdollahi, the conversation focused on the influence of their migrant experiences on their professional work and public engagement.

							<p>This conversation is just one example of the gathering work Shalom Aleikum is doing to intentionally bring together Jewish-Muslim populations in Berlin. More than just the talk, what really set this event apart was the discussion that took place after, merged with beautiful plates of Mediterranean delights. Over hummus, baklava, and saffron rice, attendees of Jewish, German, Muslim, and Arab descent, chatted with us. From a passionate educator breaking down cultural prejudice in German schools to a Jewish educator researching models for coexistence across Europe alongside a few twenty somethings decked out in classic Berlin style (only wearing black), the meal brought everyone together, taking the conversation from the stage to the masses.
