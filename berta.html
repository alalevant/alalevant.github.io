							<h2>Berta</h2>
							<p> Our journey interviewing the small, yet vibrant scene of Israeli chefs in Berlin took us to Assaf Granit’s newest unopened restaurant, BERTA. Inspired by Assaf’s grandma, born in Jerusalem, and paired with the revival of Berlin in the roaring 20’s BERTA is an anticipated opening. The collective of three chefs opening the restaurant see in their vision that, “BERTA is a place of celebration, warmth and generosity, where the most diverse cultures meet and celebrate food and life together.”

						<div class="content">
							<p>We sat down with <b>Ben Barabi</b> the restaurant's chef and lead in Berlin to learn more about his vision for the restaurant. As a fusion of the Middle East and European cuisine, he describes the taste as, “Ashkenazi food with some spice.” It will be a place to bring Berlin and Jerusalem together, identifying as an Israeli restaurant. When asked—what is Israeli food he comments, “New Israeli food is not Israeli at all-- we go abroad, take everything back, and make it ours.” Being Israeli is a part of their restaurant's identity, attracting Israeli tourists and local Germans alike. He notes that they chose Berlin because when you are good in Berlin, restaurants are anecdotally open with stability in the long term, while in Tel Aviv’s food scene you must be constantly changing and new.

							<p>As with many of the restaurants we interviewed, Barabi interacts with the network of Arab suppliers to source food for his restaurants. He notes that this type of interaction is normal, and a part of the restaurant business here in Berlin.  <br>
BERTA plans to use innovative food and a welcoming casual atmosphere to invite a new audience in Berlin, not  just to experience something new, but “to feel like they are coming home”.
