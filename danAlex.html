							<h2>Dan Alexander</h2>
							<p> <b>Dan Alexander</b>, a designer, foodie, and co-author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ariel-Rosenthal/dp/9655729826">On the Hummus Route </a>, starts by telling us, “I am not a fan of hummus.” 
<br>
It was at a bar in Paris that he found himself in a screaming match with two men of Lebanese and Palestinian descent. He reflects on this encounter as the start, “Hummus is a battlefield in the middle east and it is something very explosive….I have a lot of interest in food. I have a lot of interest in design. But the main thing is I have a lot of interest in people and humanity.” This experience helped him come up with the idea of creating a book with people from all over the middle east about hummus. From the beginning, it was not an easy journey. Co-authors and contributors had to take many risks to participate and others dismissed him completely. Adamant about the importance of his mission, Alexander decided, “This book is about people and about dreams, not about flags.” On the Hummus Route takes the readers on a journey between people, cities, and dreams, not nationality. He says, “it was a personal quest” with thirty fellow participants from across the middle east. He asked them simply to participate in coming up with something about hummus, from art to philosophy to poetry.

							<p>He realized that his book would take his readers on a journey that could not be done today. He jokes about the idea of traveling from Cairo all the way to Damascus via Gaza, Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Nazareth, Jerusalem, Acre, and Beirut,“With an Israeli passport, I can start it but not finish it.” As a designer, he worked extensively to find local photographers that he could collaborate with for a cohesive yet unique take on hummus. The book ended up being 406 pages and is self-published, with global acclaim.

 Finding the balance between Israel and the rest of the middle east was not simple. Alexander decided to include that it was “Printed somewhere in the mediterranean” in order to avoid any implications about ties with Israel.However, the book's title is written in Hebrew (alongside English and Arabic) as an ode to ancient Hebrew and its essential connection to the middle east. He notes that in an interview with an Israeli publication, he said that he didn’t want the book translated into Hebrew, a source of major pushback.

							<p>In Alexander's eyes, “It's not about hummus, it is about a new social order in the middle east. It is really to offer people how we can raise our children and what kind of future we want to have as human beings.” The vision for ‘On the Hummus Route’ is one of optimism, a manifestation of a new kind of interwoven identity that goes beyond the failed power dynamics of “coexistence.”
